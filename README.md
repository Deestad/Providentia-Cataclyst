## Purpose of this automaton
Discord bot built for spying and war. Made with SQL and Python using the module discord.py Uses panda and matplot for data and statistical analysis. Has commands relating to fun and memes, and also facial recognition of discord attachments. More content is planned to be invented for the bot.

## How did the name "Providentia" originate?
Providentia was a divine personification of the ability to foresee and make provision in ancient Roman religion. She was not one of the major Olympian gods, but rather an abstract concept personified. Unlike many Roman deities who had rich mythologies and complex narratives surrounding them, Providentia had little to no mythology associated with her.

However, she played a significant role in Roman culture and politics. She was often depicted on coins and public buildings, symbolizing the emperor's wisdom and foresight in governing the empire. She was also invoked in prayers and rituals for prosperity and stability.


## What does Providentia Cataclyst X represent?

This remarkable bot, **Providentia - Type C**, is the brainchild of the illustrious empire of Lygon Xin, renowned as the nation of Kaisara. Originally designed from the Model of Ryujin, with the sole purpose of obliterating Jambonia, Providentia has since evolved into an essential utilitarian tool and a stalwart guardian of server security.

Born from the crucible of war, Cataclyst is a relentless machine of destruction. Its initial purpose was to wage war, and it has evolved into an even more fearsome instrument of chaos. This relentless automaton not only defends the empire but actively seeks out and obliterates its enemies. With enhanced capabilities in espionage and warfare machinery, Cataclyst is the embodiment of ruthless aggression and the empire's most formidable weapon, ushering in a new era of conquest and domination.
